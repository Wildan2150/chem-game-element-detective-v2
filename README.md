# ElementDetective Chemistry Game

## Overview

ElementDetective is an educational game designed to help players learn about the elements of the periodic table and chemical bonding. The game is divided into two main phases: the Mystery Element Challenge and the Bonding Challenge.

## Game Rules

### Mystery Element Challenge

1.  **Mystery Element Selection:**
    *   A mystery element is randomly selected from the first 20 elements of the periodic table.
2.  **Clues:**
    *   Four clues are provided in a specific order to help you identify the mystery element.
    *   Clue 1: State of matter at room temperature.
    *   Clue 2: Group and period on the periodic table.
    *   Clue 3: A common real-world application.
    *   Clue 4: Electron configuration and atomic mass.
3.  **Guess Attempts:**
    *   You have three attempts to guess the element correctly for each revealed clue.
4.  **Input:**
    *   You can enter either the element's name or its symbol as your guess.
5.  **Feedback:**
    *   If your guess is incorrect, you'll receive feedback to guide you closer to the correct answer, such as hints about the atomic number, group, period, or state of matter.
    *   If you run out of guesses for a clue, the next clue is revealed, and your score is reduced by 10 points.

### Bonding Challenge Phase

1.  **Bonding Scenario:**
    *   Once you correctly identify the mystery element, you'll proceed to the Bonding Challenge.
    *   The game pairs the mystery element with a bonding partner based on chemical properties.
2.  **Multiple-Choice Questions:**
    *   You'll be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions about the type of bond formed, electron behavior, and properties of the resulting compound.
3.  **Visual Aids:**
    *   Electron dot diagrams are displayed for both the mystery element and its bonding partner to help visualize valence electrons.
4.  **Explanations:**
    *   Detailed explanations are provided for each answer to enhance your understanding of chemical bonding concepts.

### Scoring System

*   **Mystery Element:** Correctly guessing the mystery element awards points.
*   **Bonding Questions:** Answering bonding questions correctly awards 50 points per question.
*   **Final Grade:** A final grade is calculated based on your total score:
    *   A+ (250+ points)
    *   A (225-249 points)
    *   B+ (200-224 points)
    *   B (175-199 points)
    *   C+ (150-174 points)
    *   C (125-149 points)
    *   D+ (100-124 points)
    *   D (75-99 points)
    *   F (Below 75 points)

## How to Play

1.  Start the game.
2.  Read the first clue and enter your guess for the mystery element.
3.  Use the feedback to refine your guesses.
4.  Once you correctly identify the element, proceed to the Bonding Challenge.
5.  Answer the bonding questions to the best of your ability.
6.  Save your score and play again!

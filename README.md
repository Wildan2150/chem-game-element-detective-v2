## üéÆ Gameplay

The game unfolds in two exciting phases:

### 1. Mystery Element Challenge

* **Element Selection:** A mystery element (from the first 20) is randomly chosen.
* **Clues:** You receive 4 clues, revealed one by one, to help you identify it:
    1.  State of matter at room temperature.
    2.  Group and period on the periodic table.
    3.  A common real-world application.
    4.  Electron configuration and atomic mass.
* **Guess Attempts:** You have **3** attempts to guess correctly for each clue.
* **Input:** Enter either the element's name or its symbol.
* **Feedback:** If incorrect, you'll get hints (e.g., atomic number, group). If you run out of guesses, the next clue appears, and your score is reduced by 10 points.

### 2. Bonding Challenge Phase

* **Bonding Scenario:** Once you identify the mystery element, it's paired with another element for the Bonding Challenge.
* **Multiple-Choice Questions:** Answer questions about bond types, electron behavior, and compound properties.
* **Visual Help:** Electron dot diagrams are displayed.
* **Learning:** Detailed explanations are provided for each answer.
